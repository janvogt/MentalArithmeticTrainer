Simple yet effective trainer for mental arithmetic. Stay fit, stay smart ;)

#Dependencies

You need to have python 3.x installed and in your path.

#Usage

./MAT.py [exercise_type ...]

If no exercise type is given multiplication of numbers between 1 and 9 is selected.

Availiable excercise types:

- **mult** - multiplication of numbers between 1 and 9
- **multbig** - multiplication of numbers between 1 and 20
- **pow** - squares of numbers between 1 and 20 and cubes of numbers between 1 and 9
- **root** - square roots of numbers between 1 and 20 and cubic roots of numbers between 1 and 9

You can combine multible excercise types by separating them with spaces.

If your done or need a break press ctrl+c. Continue with any key and exit by pressing ctrl+c a second time.

On exit or if you after finishing a round (all possible calculations) your current stats are printed. These contain the **total number** of equations solved, the **number and percentage of correct** responses and the **mean response time im msec**.

#Contribution

This was a one hour project of mine, because I wanted to practice mental arithmetic a little more. Do what ever you want with it, and feel free to PR your additions - I will most likely accept them.
Ideas I had but did not need, were:
- New execrcise types like division, ...
- A GUI
- Performance adaptive selection of exercises...
